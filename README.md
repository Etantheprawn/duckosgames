<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About DuckOS ü™ê

![Screenshot of DuckOS]([https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1141194299996897320/1162793530813583500/7Hu7Nyu.png?ex=657499dd&is=656224dd&hm=6c3a3bf31d8f414aedafdace83e9d65b1b213f3aea606137f3d3772feb8f130c&=&format=webp&quality=lossless&width=1432&height=676])

There are so many web-based operating systems out there for this purpose... (I won't call out names) but I never tought they feel like a real Operating System. That's when I got the idea of creating my own web-based operating system, with a unique look and packed with features, having a goal of being at least 90% bug-free and easy to use. But why should you choose to use DuckOS over the others?

Here's why:
* Meets the standards. Modern, simple and user-friendly interface.
* Powerful. Equipped with the best flagship proxies to help you go on unblocked sites.
* Flexible. Easily customize, develop and integrate.

Of course, DuckOS isn't created to replace your real Operating System (MacOS, Windows, etc). It will always be a project I made just for fun, with NO GOALS OF MAKING SCHOOL DISTRICTS CHASE AFTER ME

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Self-Hosting üíæ
These are instructions on hosting DuckOS by yourself.

### Prerequisites

* 28MB of Disk Space (1MB if you replace the images with FontAwesome)
* Your own Domain
* Static Web Hosting Service

### Installation


1. Make a fork DuckOS's Github Repo
2. You can host DuckOS on a static web hosting service like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) (There are many other options available) <br>

**That's it! With just two steps, you can get DuckOS up and running ;) However, if you want dynamic proxies to work, you'll have to do a bit more work and add a subdomain accordingly with the proxies app.**
